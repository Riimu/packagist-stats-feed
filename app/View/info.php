 <h1>User Agent Info</h1>

 <p>Hello, and good day to you! I see you must have gotten here after becoming
     curious about the user agent string. Have no worries, we're all with good
     intentions here.</p>

 <p>This little web application offers a way to track the packagist download
     and star counts via an RSS feed. To accomplish this, the application needs
     to download the profile page that lists all the packages and their appropriate
     counts. It should not be downloading the profile for the same person more than
     once per hour, however.</p>

 <p>If you do have questions or have run into problems due to this application,
     I'm more than happy help and address any issues you may have. I may be reached
     via email at <em>riimu (at) riimu.net</em></p>
